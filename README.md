## Using the defined shortcuts: ##

1. While focussed on a HelpScout tab, open a draft reply on any ticket
2. Toggle the Guru Chrome extension, and search for a card in the !clips collection
3. At this point, your browser should look [like this](https://cdn.zappy.app/e4a3313324116cd9b9470bf0015d8db2.png)
4. Invoke one of [the two commands available](https://cdn.zappy.app/86322feac2bf8576e72fe458611c1301.png) in the Zapier-Guru Chrome Extension by pressing its corresponding keyboard shortcut
5. The extension should then copy the content of the selected card, close the Guru extension and focus your cursor on the reply
6. If you chose the function that also pastes the content into the draft, you should also see the contents of the Guru card appended to the end of your draft reply.

*Note:* An open PR for the extension adds some error handling, in the event that a user deviates from these steps.
